        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 18, 2026</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Slop Spot ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our mobile application.</p>
        <p>By using Slop Spot, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>Camera and Image Data Collection</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Our app uses your device camera to scan product labels for ingredient analysis and health ratings.
        </div>

        <h3>What We Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Temporary camera access to capture photos of product labels, barcodes, and ingredient lists</li>
            <li>On-device image processing to extract text from food and beverage packaging</li>
            <li>The app scans product labels to read ingredient information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How We Use It</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All image scanning and analysis occurs locally on your device</li>
            <li>We extract product names and ingredient lists from photos to calculate health ratings</li>
            <li>The ratings are provided for informational and entertainment purposes only</li>
            <li>No images, photos, or scanned data are uploaded to any server</li>
            <li>Photos are processed in real-time and immediately deleted after analysis</li>
            <li>No biometric identification, facial recognition, or personally identifiable data is extracted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What We DON'T Do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do NOT upload photos or scanned images to any server</li>
            <li>We do NOT share camera data or images with third parties</li>
            <li>We do NOT store photos on your device or our servers</li>
            <li>We do NOT use images for any purpose beyond displaying ingredient ratings</li>
            <li>We do NOT retain any image data after analysis is complete</li>
            <li>We do NOT sell or share your photos with anyone</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Retention for Images</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Images are captured and processed in real-time on your device</li>
            <li>All image data is immediately deleted from device memory after the ingredient analysis is displayed (typically within seconds)</li>
            <li>No image data persists on your device or anywhere else after analysis</li>
            <li>The app does not maintain any history of your photos</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Control</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You must grant camera permission to use the scanning feature</li>
            <li>You can revoke camera access at any time through your device settings</li>
            <li>Each scan requires you to actively capture a new photo</li>
            <li>No photos are taken without your explicit action</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scan History and Local Storage</h2>
        
        <h3>What We Store Locally</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan results only (product names, ingredient lists, and text-based ratings) are stored on your device only using local storage (AsyncStorage)</li>
            <li>This allows you to view your scan history within the app</li>
            <li>Your sorting preferences for viewing scan history (e.g., sort by date, name, or rating)</li>
            <li><strong>Important:</strong> No photos are stored - only text-based results (product names, ingredients, ratings)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Control Over Scan History</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete individual scans at any time using the delete button</li>
            <li>You can sort and organize your scan history using the sorting settings</li>
            <li>All scan history and preferences are stored locally on your device only</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all stored scan results and settings</li>
            <li>We have no access to your scan history - it never leaves your device</li>
            <li>No scan data is uploaded to servers or shared with anyone</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tutorial and App Features</h2>
        <p>The app includes a tutorial to help you understand how to use the scanning and analysis features. The tutorial:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Runs locally on your device</li>
            <li>Does not collect any data about your interaction with it</li>
            <li>Can be accessed or skipped at your preference</li>
            <li>Does not send any information to external servers</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Advertising features are currently integrated in the app but may not be active until verification is complete. When active, ads will be clearly displayed within the app interface.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>How Ingredient Analysis Works</h2>
        <p>The app uses on-device image recognition and text extraction to:</p>

            <li>Read product labels and ingredient lists from packaging</li>
            <li>Extract ingredient names from photos</li>
            <li>Provide health ratings based on common nutritional considerations</li>
            <li>Display information for entertainment and educational purposes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All processing happens on your device. No photos or ingredient data are sent to external servers.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Slop Spot uses the following third-party services:</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Slop Spot is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used our app, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the app and its processing systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photos are processed entirely on your device</li>
            <li>No photos are transmitted over the network</li>
            <li>Scan results are stored only on your device using secure local storage</li>
            <li>We cannot access your scan history or photos</li>
            <li>AdMob uses industry-standard security practices for data it collects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since photos are never uploaded and are immediately deleted, the risk of photo data exposure is minimized.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Regarding data we collect or store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect or store personal data, photos, or scan results on servers</li>
            <li>Once you delete the app, all local scan history is permanently removed</li>
            <li>You control scan data through your device and the in-app delete functions</li>
            <li>For advertising data collected by AdMob, you have rights under Google's privacy policies</li>
            <li>You can control ad tracking through your device settings as described in the Advertising section</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Regarding our data practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All scanning and analysis occurs on your device with no data transfers</li>
            <li>Your photos and scan results never leave your device</li>
            <li>AdMob may transfer advertising data internationally in accordance with Google's privacy practices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Region-Specific Information</h2>
        
        <h3>California Residents (CCPA)</h3>
        <p>We do not sell personal information. AdMob may collect data for advertising purposes as described above. Since we don't collect or store personal scan data on servers, CCPA data rights do not apply to that data. All scan data is stored locally on your device under your control.</p>

        <h3>European Economic Area Residents (GDPR)</h3>
        <p>Our legal basis for processing is your consent (camera permission). AdMob processes advertising data based on legitimate interests and consent where required. Since we don't store scan data on servers, GDPR data retention requirements don't apply to that data. You can withdraw camera consent by revoking access in device settings.</p>

        <h3>Australian Residents</h3>
        <p>We comply with the Australian Privacy Principles. Since we don't collect or store personal scan information on servers, APP requirements for server-side data handling don't apply to scan data. AdMob's practices are subject to Google's privacy compliance.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We will notify you of material changes through the app or other reasonable means. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
